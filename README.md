# StateBike

StateBike is a system to manage a bike network of stations of public use.

There will be one person called the Administrator of the system, who will be capable of access the administrative part of the system. Through the graphical interface, she or he will be able to obtain information about the rentals, bikes or general statistical data about one station. Plus, the Administrator will be able to modify all this information.

Each bike station will have its own employee, although one employee can have several stations to him or herself. The employee will access his or her part of the system, which he or she will be able to notify a repaired bike through.

Any person will be capable of creating his or her own user by turning up in a station and presenting the corresponding documents.

A registered user will be able to rent a bike by logging into the system and entering her or his username and password.
